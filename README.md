**Association Rule Pattern Mining on the Amazon Consumer Behaviour Dataset**

This repository contains the code for performing association rule pattern mining on the Amazon Consumer Behaviour Dataset. The dataset used in this project can be found at the following link: [Amazon Consumer Behaviour Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset).

## Contents
- The notebook "Amazon Pattern mining.ipynb" is provided in this repository. It explores and cleans the dataset, identifies frequent patterns using the FPGrowth algorithm, and finally discovers association rules. The association rules are evaluated using the Kulczynski and Imbalance Ratio indices.
Then the main association rules are saved into the file called "results.txt".

## Code Attribution
The code for calculating the evaluation indices is heavily inspired by the code available at: [Apriori Analysis Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anotherbadcode/apriori-analysis/notebook).
